## Coding Standards
### Naming Conventions
The standard Java convention of prepending a company domain to the package name has been used when creating the `za.ac.up.cs.navup` package.

### Formatting Conventions
To keep the code formatting precisely the same, the `.idea` folder containing the Android Studio project settings has been included in the commited files. This allows all team members to use the same formatting. To reformat the code after making edits, focus on the file and press `Ctrl + Alt + L` and this will reformat the code to adhere to the standards.

Any changes to the formatting conventions can be proposed in Slack and then changed in the Project Settings dialog.

### In-Code Comment Conventions
The JavaDoc coding conventions will be followed as it allows us to have documentation within the code and it can be updated as changed are made to code. The final documentation can then be compiled to HTML. JavaDoc comments can be generated using Android Studio by typing `/**` where the comment should be inserted and pressing Enter/Return. For more information on JavaDoc conventions see [this link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/index-137868.html).
